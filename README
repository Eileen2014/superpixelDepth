Repository for implementing the unary potential from Liu, Fayao, Chunhua Shen, and Guosheng Lin. "Deep convolutional neural fields for depth estimation from a single image." Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2015.

Prerequisites: Python 2.7, Tensorflow, scikit-image, numpy, matplotlib

If you have access to the pretrained weights (2gb file, pretrain/saved.ckpt), run from the superpixelDepth outer directory:

python demo.py <name of input image>

The output will be placed in the provided path of the input image, appended with the suffix ".depth.png"
